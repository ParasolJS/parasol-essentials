The minimum files necessary to create a Parasol application. 
The easiest way to create a parasol application is to download this repository, write your parasol code in the index.html file, add your data to the folder, and then run it with Python. To do so follow the following instructions.

0) Download this repository into a folder called parasol-essentials (you can name the folder whatever you'd like, for the tutorial we use parasol-essentials as our folder name)

1) Edit index.html with your Parasol code (view https://github.com/ParasolJS/parasol-es/wiki for more information) and add your data file (.csv file) to the parasol-essentials folder.

2) Ensure you have Python 3 installed, open up command prompt and type 'python -V' and make sure it says 3.x.x

3) In command prompt, set the directory to the parasol-essentials folder. To do this type: cd [insert path here]/parasol-essentials

4) Type the following command into command prompt: python -m http.server

5) Enter localhost:8000 as the url in a web browser to see the Parasol application.
